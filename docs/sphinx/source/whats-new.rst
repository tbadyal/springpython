What's new in Spring Python |version|
=====================================

Spring Python |version| has some new features.

New Features
++++++++++++

Spring Python |version| has added support for:

* :ref:`New support for Pyro 4 <pyro4>` - Since the beginning, Spring Python has provided seamless remoting by integration with Pyro. We now have support for Pyro 4.
* :ref:`Secure XML-RPC <remoting-secure-xml-rpc>` - Python provides out-of-the-box XML-RPC capabilities. This extra module makes it easy to export existing services using this capability while also enabling you to encrypt the tunnel.

There have also been bug fixes. For the most part there is little impact to the core API of Spring Python. This means that the material in the book Spring Python 1.1 is valid. It just doesn't document the new features listed above.
